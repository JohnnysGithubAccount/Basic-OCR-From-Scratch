# Basic OCR From Scratch

This project is just to get the idea on how OCR works, but not completely. 
But the idea for coding OCR from scratch using the algorithm sliding window is there, I'll be doing that soon enough.

These can't be reconized linked handwriting. 
But it's really fun to do for more thorough understanding of CNN and sime basic Image Preprocessing.
