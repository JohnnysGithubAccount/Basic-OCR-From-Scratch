# Using PyTorch

This using PyTorch, since PyTorch is very clear on how to training process work. This would be an awesome way to learn the basic of how a CNN traning loop works.

Some of the main files you need to notice are:

1. layers_learning.ipynb
   This show how the model works, how the image got through all the layers, what happend inside layers, especially Convolutional layers.
   
2. train_selected_model.py
  This script is where the training happening, you can modify the training process here.
   
3. implementing.py
   This is where everything is put together, it takes in a .png file to perform the OCR.
